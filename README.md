# Fandom Finder Demo

## Instructions
Use the starter code in `starter` to build out Fandom Finder for the current stage! All the past stages will be included in the respective folders.

## Results

Take a look inside of `mocks` to see what the final product will look like! If you get stuck, you can use the code in `finished` to keep going.

This project is extremely barebones version of the class project, but it demonstrates good concepts on how to structure and build your project.
